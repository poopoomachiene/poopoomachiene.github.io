      <h1>History of this Epic and Cruel War</h1>
    </div>

      <div class="jumbotron">

        <p> The Potato-Human war is the most epic of wars this Multiverse has know,
           one that easily more epic then The Emu War, The Chicken War of 2300,
          or even the Battle for Spooky Mushrooms. It all started before the dawn
          of time when a Potato burned a chicken not any chicken but a chicken
          owned by Bob the human. This caused an all out war that not only
          created the Multiverse but also drove potatos to near extinction
          deservedly.  In a last act of desperation the Potatos erased the
          memory of all humans and took a different strategy one of sneak.
          They made humans think potatos are harmless food, but they are much
          much worst, they are the purest form of evil as they are the EVIL.
          But few humans who are heroes found out the truth and have been fighting
          them sense the dawn of time putting them into shame and showing them who
          are the best, and the best are Humans.</p>
