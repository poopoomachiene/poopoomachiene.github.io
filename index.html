        <p>The Potato-Human war is the most epic of wars this Multiverse has know, one that easily more epic then The Emu War,
          The Chicken War of 2300, or even the Battle for Spooky Mushrooms. It all started before the dawn of time when a Potato
          burned a chicken not any chicken but a chicken owned by Bob the human. This caused an all out war that not only created
          the Multiverse but also drove potatos to near extinction deservedly.  In a last act of desperation the Potatos erased
          the memory of all humans and took a different strategy one of sneak. They made humans think potatos are harmless food,
          but they are much much worst, they are the purest form of evil as they are the EVIL.  But few humans who are heroes
          found out the truth and have been fighting them sense the dawn of time putting them into shame and showing them who
          are the best, and the best are Humans.</p>
